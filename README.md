Comprehensive outline of MVP

  //Here is our 30sec pitch. Feel free to revise as needed.

  - Route Runner is an errand map integrating Google Maps to find the most efficient route for you to run your errand. The app also includes a Notes feature that allows you to add lists or reminders for each destination you set.

Mockups/wireframes of relevant pages

  - I will be working on this over the next couple of days and upload images as they're finished.

Done with research into which APIs to use
  - In progress...

Areas of responsibility outlined

  - Morgan: Backend/Database
  - Tim: Front-end/Back-end as needed

  - Stephen: Front-end/JS as needed

  //We need to write some inital tests for what we expect the app to do. Full stack analysis.
